    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> JP is a 1st Year college student at CIIT College of Arts and Technology, currently taking Game Development in BS in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing (BSEMC). Although he has no knowledge in developing or coding, he has great interest in the field of game development. One goal of his is to work for Naughty Dog as a concept artist/game developer. Another is to lead or make a game himself. If those don't work out he'd love to be a frontman for a rock band. He is committed to expanding his set of skills and being an awesome person.</p>
